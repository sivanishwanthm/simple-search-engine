# simple-search-engine
The goal of this project is to implement a simple search engine on Wikipedia Sentences dataset. This dataset consists of 7.8 million sentences. We start with creating an inverted index and then implement a ranking algorithm like TF-IDF. This project aims to demonstrate the fundamental principles behind building a simple search engine that can process and retrieve documents based on user queries.
